# Shapeai-Python-and-Network-Security-Project
I made this project during the **_7 Days Free Bootcamp_**, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI
</b>.
The instructor during the session was Harsh Akshit bhaiya (Instructor and Mentor at Google). I got to
learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.
<br><br>Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well<br>

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>Python
<li>Functions
<li>Fundamentals of Networking
<li>Cryptography
<li>MD5 Hashing
<li>Algorithm Hashing
<br>During these 7 days, everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience in programming can learn.
I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit:
